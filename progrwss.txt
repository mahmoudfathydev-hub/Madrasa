4. ANIMATIONS DETAIL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Framer Motion
   - Used in: `Aspirations.jsx`, `Testimonials.jsx`
   - Techniques:
     - `staggerChildren`: Used in Aspirations to animate cards in sequence.
     - `whileInView`: Triggers animations when elements scroll into view.
     - `AnimatePresence`: Handles exit animations for Testimonial slides.
     - `drag`: Enables swipe gestures on Testimonials.
     - `variants`: Organized animation states (hidden, visible, enter, exit).
     - `whileHover`: Scale and lift effects on cards.

B. CSS / SCSS Transitions
   - Used in: `CoursesCard`, `HeroBanner`, `WhyMadrasa`, `Navbar`
   - Techniques:
     - `transition: all 0.3s ease`: Smooth hover effects for colors, shadows, and transforms.
     - `transform`: Used for scaling images and moving elements.
     - 3D Transforms: Likely used for the "Flip Card" effect in WhyMadrasa section.
     - Background Animations: Moving/floating background shapes in HeroBanner and WhyMadrasa.

5. DATA HANDLING
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Data is primarily driven by `i18next` translation files (JSON).
- `coursesData` and `testimonials` are fetched via `t('key', { returnObjects: true })`.
- Images are imported directly in components.
